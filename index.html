            <div class="project">
                <h3>StudyZone</h3>
                <p class="tech-stack">(.NET 9, PostgreSQL, Minimal APIs, Dapper)</p>
                <p>My friend and I worked on this freelance project, ASP.NET Core in the backend and Flutter in the frontend, and successfully took it to production with really high priority, with auto-scalable features, and learned a lot from it. You can check it out from here. We used PostgreSQL as a database to get high performance and scalability, and handle our queries with Dapper for high performance and flexibility in optimization, and for migrations, we used the DBUP package to handle it. We also learned from this project how to work with Gitflow and make branches and pull requests, and code review. We got Good TeamWork experience from this project.</p>
                <p>Developed and deployed a comprehensive education platform across multiple modules, including registration, subjects, quizzes, library, notifications, and user interaction.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Subjects module consists of many integrated parts. Teachers have videos and books, and playlists, and every subject has chapters and lectures, and quizzes.</li>
                    <li>Question Bank: We want to build a dynamic quizzes system, so we will build a bank to store questions that are linked to tags and have a difficulty level, and we will generate quizzes from it based on its requirements from tags and difficulties</li>
                    <li>The Teachers have a profile that contains their video playlists and the books they have in our library</li>
                    <li>We used Firebase FCM to build a reliable notification system.</li>
                    <li>We built a library that has two types of sections: teacher-based sections and subject page sections.</li>
                    <li>The Playlists feature has three types of playlists: teacher playlist and student playlist, and default playlist, a list to watch later.</li>
                    <li>In the trending feature, we built a view that updates every 30 minutes to enhance the performance and not to calculate it in each request to get the trending(videos, books, playlists)</li>
                    <li>We also made a top students based on a points system to motivate students to study more and more, and we built a reward system with badges and diamonds to gamify the app.</li>
                    <li>We are still working on this project to implement new features and grow it, We haven't reached half of our goal in it yet.</li>

                <h3>Intelligent Assistance for Personalized Planning</h3>
                <p class="tech-stack">(.NET 9, PostgreSQL, Minimal APIs, SignalR, EF Core)</p>
                <p>Developed the backend of an AI-driven goal-tracking platform as part of my graduation project, focused on helping users set, track, and achieve SMART goals through personalized planning and habit monitoring. The project is currently a work in progress.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed clean, modular REST APIs using .NET 9 Minimal APIs, balancing performance with maintainability.</li>
                    <li>Implemented real-time features using SignalR, allowing instant updates for goal progress, habit status, and focus tracking.</li>
                    <li>Managed data with PostgreSQL and Entity Framework Core, ensuring reliable, consistent, and efficient data handling.</li>
